    "generated_answer": "To compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) without factoring them, we can use the Euclidean algorithm. The Euclidean algorithm is based on the principle that the GCD of two numbers also divides their difference. Here is a step-by-step description of the algorithm:\n\n1. **Initial Step:** Start with the pair \\((a, b)\\) where \\(a \\geq b\\).\n2. **Division Step:** Perform the division of \\(a\\) by \\(b\\) to get the quotient \\(q\\) and the remainder \\(r\\). This can be written as:\n   \\[\n   a = bq + r \\quad \\text{where} \\quad 0 \\leq r < b\n   \\]\n3. **Update Step:** Replace \\(a\\) with \\(b\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(r\\) to form the new pair \\((b, r)\\).\n4. **Repeat Step:** Repeat the division and update steps until \\(r\\) becomes 0. When \\(r\\) is 0, the current value of \\(b\\) is the GCD of the original pair \\((a, b)\\).\n\nHere is the Euclidean algorithm implemented in Python:\n\n```python\ndef gcd(a, b):\n    while b!= 0:\n        a, b = b, a % b\n    return a\n```\n\nLet's break down the algorithm with an example. Suppose we want to find the GCD of 48 and 18.\n\n1. Start with the pair \\((48, 18)\\).\n2. Perform the division \\(48 \\div 18\\):\n   \\[\n   48 = 18 \\cdot 2 + 12\n   \\]\n   So, replace \\(48\\) with \\(18\\) and \\(18\\) with \\(12\\). The new pair is \\((18, 12)\\).\n3. Perform the division \\(18 \\div 12\\):\n   \\[\n   18 = 12 \\cdot 1 + 6\n   \\]\n   So, replace \\(18\\) with \\(12\\) and \\(12\\) with \\(6\\). The new pair is \\((12, 6)\\).\n4. Perform the division \\(12 \\div 6\\):\n   \\[\n   12 = 6 \\cdot 2 + 0\n   \\]\n   So, replace \\(12\\) with \\(6\\) and \\(6\\) with \\(0\\). The new pair is \\((6, 0)\\).\n5. Since the remainder is now 0, the GCD is the current value of \\(b\\), which is 6.\n\nTherefore, the GCD of 48 and 18 is \\(\\boxed{6}\\). The Euclidean algorithm is efficient and works for any pair of positive integers. The final answer in LaTeX code is:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{ Euclidean algorithm}}\n\\]"
