    "generated_answer": "To compute the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) using the Euclidean algorithm, follow these steps:\n\n1. **Initialization**: Given two integers \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(a > b\\).\n2. **Division**: Compute the remainder \\(r\\) when \\(a\\) is divided by \\(b\\): \\(r = a \\mod b\\).\n3. **Update**: Replace \\(a\\) with \\(b\\) and \\(b\\) with \\(r\\). Now, \\(a\\) becomes \\(b\\) and \\(b\\) becomes \\(r\\).\n4. **Repeat**: Repeat steps 2 and 3 until \\(b\\) becomes 0.\n5. **Termination**: When \\(b\\) becomes 0, the value of \\(a\\) is the GCD of the original two integers.\n\nHere is the algorithm in LaTeX code:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\\text{GCD}(a, b) = \\begin{cases} \na & \\text{if } b = 0 \\\\\n\\text{GCD}(b, a \\mod b) & \\text{otherwise}\n\\end{cases}}\n\\]\n\nTo illustrate this with an example, let's find the GCD of \\(a = 48\\) and \\(b = 18\\):\n\n1. \\(a = 48\\), \\(b = 18\\)\n2. \\(r = 48 \\mod 18 = 12\\)\n3. \\(a = 18\\), \\(b = 12\\)\n4. \\(r = 18 \\mod 12 = 6\\)\n5. \\(a = 12\\), \\(b = 6\\)\n6. \\(r = 12 \\mod 6 = 0\\)\n7. \\(a = 6\\), \\(b = 0\\)\n\nSince \\(b\\) is now 0, the GCD is \\(a = 6\\).\n\nThus, the GCD of 48 and 18 is \\(\\boxed{6}\\)."
