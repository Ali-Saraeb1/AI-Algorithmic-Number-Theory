Here is a step-by-step algorithm:\n\n1. **Convert \\( n \\) to its binary form.**\n2. **Initialize an accumulator \\( y \\) to 1.**\n3. **For each bit in the binary representation of \\( n \\) starting from the least significant bit:**\n   - If the bit is 1, update \\( y \\) to \\( y \\cdot x \\).\n   - Square \\( x \\).\n4. **Return \\( y \\).**\n\nLet's write this algorithm in LaTeX code:\n\n\\[\n\\boxed{\n\\begin{array}{l}\n\\text{function } \\text{ binary\\_ exponentiation}(x, n): \\\\\n\\quad 1. \\text{ convert } n \\text{ to its binary form} \\\\\n\\quad 2. \\text{ initialize } y \\leftarrow 1 \\\\\n\\quad 3. \\text{ for each bit } b \\text{ in the binary representation of } n \\text{ starting from the least significant bit} \\\\\n\\quad \\quad \\text{ if } b = 1, \\text{ update } y \\leftarrow y \\cdot x \\\\\n\\quad \\quad \\text{ square } x \\text{ (i.e., } x \\leftarrow x^2 \\text{)} \\\\\n\\quad 4. \\text{ return } y \\\\\n\\end{array}\n}\n\\]\n\nThis algorithm minimizes the number of multiplications required to compute \\( x^n \\) by using the properties of exponents and the binary representation of \\( n \\).
