\section{Computing the Binary GCD (Stein’s) Algorithm Using Even–Odd Properties}

\subsection*{Question}
Compute the greatest common divisor \( \gcd(48, 30) \) using the Binary GCD (Stein’s) Algorithm, which relies only on even/odd checks, subtraction, and halving.This method, known as the Binary GCD (or Stein’s) Algorithm, relies on the properties of even and odd numbers to simplify the computation.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsubsection*{Few‑Shot Hinting}
Try these pairs by hand and look for a small, parity‑based move that reduces their size without changing their gcd:
\[
(4,2),\quad (9,3),\quad (5,12),\quad (15,6).
\]
What uniform transformation applies when both share parity?  When they differ?  When both are odd?

\subsection*{Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT) Prompting}
*"Begin with trivial endpoints (\(a=0\) or \(b=0\)).  Then at each step:
1. Inspect whether \(a\) and \(b\) share the same parity or not.
2. Choose a simple parity‑based update or a difference‑based move.
3. Ensure each move strictly reduces \(\max(a,b)\) while preserving \(\gcd(a,b)\).
Repeat until one value vanishes."*

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
*"Outline:
1. Handle zeros.
2. Loop:
   - Use parity tests to select one of two reduction rules.
   - Apply the rule that shrinks the larger argument.
3. End when one argument is zero; return the other."*

\subsection*{Self‑Consistency}
Every transformation—whether a parity alignment or an odd‑odd subtraction—must keep the gcd invariant and strictly decrease a size measure, guaranteeing termination.

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
*"Reflect:
- Which parity pattern triggers which reduction?
- How does your chosen step guarantee the larger of \((a,b)\) decreases?
- Why does this process always terminate with the correct gcd?"*

\subsection*{Chain‑of‑Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
*"Let \(\pi(x)\) denote parity.  Then define a map
\[
(a,b)\;\mapsto\;(a',b')
\]
so that  
\[
\pi(a'),\pi(b')\in\{\text{even},\text{odd}\},
\quad
\max(a',b')<\max(a,b),
\quad
\gcd(a',b')=\gcd(a,b).
\]
Iterate until one coordinate is zero."*

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item **Base:** if \(a=0\) or \(b=0\), return the other.
  \item **Parity Phase:** if \(a,b\) share parity, apply a paired reduction.
  \item **Alignment Phase:** otherwise, apply a parity‑alignment step.
  \item **Reduction Phase:** when both are odd, apply a size‑reducing subtraction.
  \item **Repeat** until one argument vanishes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
\begin{itemize}
  \item **Action:** Check for zero arguments.  
    **Reasoning:** Trivial gcd.
  \item **Action:** Test parities of \(a\) and \(b\).  
    **Reasoning:** Parity guides which reduction preserves gcd.
  \item **Action:** Apply the selected parity‑driven or subtraction rule.  
    **Reasoning:** Each rule reduces the larger argument.
  \item **Conclusion:** When one argument is zero, the other is the gcd.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
*"Iterate until one input is zero by alternating:
- a parity‑alignment move when parities differ,
- a paired reduction when they match,
- and a subtraction‑based reduction when both are odd.
Each move preserves the gcd and reduces the problem size.  The nonzero remainder is the gcd."*

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
Step 1: Initial check  
Neither 48 nor 30 is zero.

Step 2: Remove all common factors of 2:  
\[
\text{Both 48 and 30 are even} \Rightarrow \text{divide both by 2}: \\
48 \to 24, \quad 30 \to 15, \quad \text{factor} = 1
\]

Step 3: Make sure the smaller number is odd  
\[
24 \text{ is even } \Rightarrow 24 \to 12 \to 6 \to 3 \quad \text{(divide by 2 three times)}
\]

Now we have:  
\[
a = 3, \quad b = 15
\]

Step 4: Reduce the pair using subtraction and halving:
\[
15 \text{ is odd}, \\
\text{Since } 15 > 3, \text{ subtract: } b = 15 - 3 = 12 \\
12 \text{ is even } \Rightarrow 12 \to 6 \to 3
\]

Now \( b = 3 \), and we repeat:
\[
a = 3, b = 3 \Rightarrow b = b - a = 0
\]

Step 5: Reintroduce factor of 2:
\[
\gcd(48, 30) = 3 \times 2^1 = 6
\]

Final Answer:
\[
\gcd(48, 30) = 6
\]
