\section{Solving Euler’s Totient Sieve}

\subsection*{Question}
Given a positive integer \(N\), design an \(O(N\log\log N)\) algorithm to compute  
\(\phi(n)\) for all \(1\le n\le N\) via a sieve-like procedure. Recall that \(\phi\) is multiplicative and  
\(\phi(p^k)=p^{k-1}(p-1)\) for prime \(p\).  Fill an array \(\phi[1..N]\) by exploiting these properties in a single pass per prime.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few‑Shot Hinting}
Work \(N=6\) by hand:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Initialize \(\phi[i]=i\) for \(1\le i\le6\).
  \item Find entries still equal to their index—these mark primes.
  \item Observe how each prime’s own entry drops by exactly one “unit” of its original size.
  \item Attempt to apply that same proportional drop to every multiple of that prime.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT) Prompting}
*"Label each integer \(i\) by itself.  When you see \(i\) still labelled \(i\), declare it prime: reduce its label by one unit in proportion to its size, then use that proportional reduction to update all its multiples in one traversal."*

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
*"Phase 1: set \(\phi[i]:=i\).  
Phase 2: detect \(\phi[p]=p\) as prime \(p\), reduce \(\phi[p]\) accordingly.  
Phase 3: propagate that exact multiplicative factor to \(\phi(p\cdot k)\) for all \(k\)."*

\subsection*{Self‑Consistency}
*"No matter which prime \(p\) you process first, as long as you apply its multiplicative effect exactly once to each multiple, the final \(\phi\)-array remains the same."*

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
*"Ask yourself:  
1. How does initializing \(\phi[i]=i\) reveal primes without explicit primality tests?  
2. Once I note how \(\phi[p]\) changes, how do I reuse that relative change for every composite \(p\,k\)?"*

\subsection*{Chain‑of‑Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
*"Formally:
\[
\phi[i]\gets i,\quad
\text{if }\phi[p]=p\;\bigl(\text{prime}\bigr),\;
\phi[p]\gets p-1,
\;\forall k\ge2:\;\phi[p\,k]\gets \phi[p\,k]\times\frac{\phi[p]}{p}.
\]"*

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item \textbf{Init:} \(\phi[i]\leftarrow i\).  
  \item \textbf{Detect:} for \(i=2\) to \(N\), if \(\phi[i]=i\), set \(\phi[i]\leftarrow i-1\).  
  \item \textbf{Propagate:} for each multiple \(j=i\cdot2,i\cdot3,\dots\le N\), apply the same scaling.  
  \item \textbf{Skip:} any \(j\) with \(\phi[j]\neq j\) has been processed—do not repeat.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
\begin{itemize}
  \item **Action:** Initialize \(\phi[i]=i\).  
  \item **Reasoning:** Unchanged entries indicate primes.  
  \item **Action:** On prime \(p\), reduce \(\phi[p]\) by exactly one “fraction” of its original size, then apply that fraction to all multiples \(j=p\,k\).  
  \item **Reasoning:** One pass per prime covers all contributions.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
*"1. Allocate \(\phi[1..N]\) with \(\phi[i]=i\).  
2. For \(i=2\) to \(N\):  
   - If \(\phi[i]=i\), treat \(i\) as prime \(p\), set \(\phi[p]:=p-1\).  
   - Then for each \(j=p\cdot k\le N\), multiply \(\phi[j]\) by the same factor \(\phi[p]/p\).  
   - Skip any \(j\) once \(\phi[j]\neq j\).  
3. Return the fully populated \(\phi\)-array."*

            for j in range(2*p, N+1, p):
                phi[j] = phi[j] * phi[p] // p  # multiplicative update
