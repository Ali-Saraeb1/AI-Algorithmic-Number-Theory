\section{Chinese Remainder Theorem for Two Congruences}
\subsection*{Question}
find an integer x that satisfies the following congruences:
\[
x \equiv 1 (mod 2)
x \equiv 2 (mod 3)
\]
Express your answer as the unique solution modulo 2 × 3. Your solution should combine the two congruences into one without disclosing the internal details of the algorithm.

\subsection*{Hints}


\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
Consider these simple instances:
### Example 1
  \( x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}, \quad x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \)

**Solution:**  
  \( x = 2 + 3k \), then substituting into the second congruence:  
  \( 2 + 3k \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), so  
  \( 3k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).  
  Thus,  
  \( k \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), so \( k = 2 + 5t \).  
  Thus,  
  \( x = 2 + 3(2 + 5t) = 8 + 15t \).  
  Thus,  
  \( x \equiv 8 \pmod{15} \).

### Example 2 
  \( x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \quad x \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \)

- **Solution:**  
  \( x = 1 + 4k \), then substituting into the second congruence:  
  \( 1 + 4k \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), so  
  \( 4k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).  
  Thus,
  \( k \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), so \( k = 2 + 7t \).  
  Thus,  
  \( x = 1 + 4(2 + 7t) = 9 + 28t \).  
  Thus,
  \( x \equiv 9 \pmod{28} \).

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
"Notice that from the first congruence, one can express \(x\) as an equation. Use the second equation."

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
"Step by step, ask:
1. How can you express \(x\) based on the first congruence?
2. Use the second equation.
3. How does this help you construct the unique solution \(x\) modulo \(m_1 \cdot m_2\)?"

---

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
"Keep in mind:
- The representation of \(x\) from the first congruence is key.
- Use the second equation
- Solving this reduced equation should yield a value that, when substituted back, gives an \(x\) satisfying both congruences."

---

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
"Reflect on the following:
- By expressing \(x\) in terms of \(a\) and an integer multiple of \(m_1\), you naturally incorporate the first condition.
-Use the second equation.
- The overall strategy ensures that the final candidate \(x\) meets both congruences."

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
"Summarize the idea symbolically:
- Write \(x \) in an equation in integers.
- Use the second equation.
- Use the resulting relation to determine \(k\) modulo \(m_2\), thereby yielding \(x\) modulo \(m_1 m_2\)."

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
"Outline your conceptual approach:
1. **Express \(x\):** Begin by writing \(x\) in an equation in \( Z \) (the integers).
2. Use the second equation.
3. **Reconstruct:**Express your answer modulo \(m_1 \cdot m_2\)."

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
"Proceed with these steps:
- **Reasoning:** How can we represent \(x\) as an equation in terms of \(m_1 \)?
- **Action:** Use the second equation.
- **Conclusion:** Construct \(x\) modulo \(m_1 \cdot m_2\)."

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
"For the system
\[
x \equiv a \pmod{m_1} \quad \text{and} \quad x \equiv b \pmod{m_2},
\]
with \(\gcd(m_1, m_2) = 1\):
1. Consider expressing \(x\) in term \(m_1\).
2. Use the second equation.
3. Ensure the final result is presented modulo \(m_1 \cdot m_2\).


\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
Step 1: Express x from the first congruence.
- Since \( x \equiv 1 (mod 2) \), write x = 1 + 2k for some integer k.

Step 2: Substitute this expression into the second congruence.
- Replace \( x in x \equiv 2 (mod 3) \) to get:
  \( 1 + 2k \equiv 2 (mod 3) \)

Step 3: Simplify and solve for k.
- Subtract 1 from both sides:
  \( 2k \equiv 1 (mod 3) \)
- Find the modular inverse of 2 modulo 3. Since \( 2 × 2 = 4 \equiv 1 (mod 3) \), the inverse of 2 is 2.
- Multiply both sides by 2:
  \( k \equiv 2 (mod 3) \)
- Hence, k = 2 + 3t for some integer t.

Step 4: Substitute back to find x.
- x = 1 + 2k = 1 + 2(2 + 3t) = 1 + 4 + 6t = 5 + 6t

Final Answer:
The unique solution is \( x \equiv 5 (mod 6) \).
