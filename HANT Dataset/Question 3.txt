\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
Step-by-Step Computation:
--------------------------
1. Verify that gcd(3, 11) = 1:
   - Compute 11 mod 3: 
         11 = 3 * 3 + 2  → remainder = 2.
   - Compute 3 mod 2:
         3 = 2 * 1 + 1   → remainder = 1.
   - Compute 2 mod 1:
         2 = 1 * 2 + 0   → remainder = 0.
   - Since the last non-zero remainder is 1, gcd(3, 11) = 1.

2. Express gcd(3, 11) = 1 as a linear combination of 3 and 11:
   - From the division: 
         3 = 2 * 1 + 1, we can write: 
         1 = 3 - 2 * 1.
   - Also, from:
         11 = 3 * 3 + 2, we can write: 
         2 = 11 - 3 * 3.
   - Substitute the expression for 2 into the previous equation:
         1 = 3 - (11 - 3 * 3)
         1 = 3 - 11 + 3 * 3
         1 = 4 * 3 - 1 * 11.
   - This shows that the coefficient of 3 is 4.

3. Conclude the multiplicative inverse:
   - Since 1 = 4 * 3 - 1 * 11, the multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4.
   - Verification:
         3 * 4 = 12, and 12 mod 11 = 1.

Final Answer:
The multiplicative inverse of 3 modulo 11 is 4.
