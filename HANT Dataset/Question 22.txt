\section{Zeckendorf’s Representation via a Greedy Algorithm}

\subsection*{Question}
Every positive integer can be uniquely written as the sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers (this is Zeckendorf's theorem).  Find the Zeckendorf representation of \( N = 76 \), which expresses it as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers.

For example, the number 100 can be expressed as
\[
100 = 89 + 8 + 3.
\]
Your task is to output its Zeckendorf representation as a sum of non-consecutive Fibonacci numbers. The output should list the Fibonacci numbers in descending order, separated by plus signs.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few‑Shot Hinting}
Examine small cases \(N=4,5,6,7\):
\begin{enumerate}
  \item List all Fibonacci numbers \(\le N\).
  \item Observe which term “dominates” each \(N\).
  \item Check how the remaining gap falls below the next smaller Fibonacci index.
  \item Note that once a term is used, its immediate predecessor can never fit.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT) Prompting}
*"Think of \(N\) as a resource.  You have precomputed “units” (Fibonacci terms) sorted descending.  Consume the largest unit your resource can afford, then observe how the leftover resource automatically excludes the next smaller unit."*

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
*"Phase 1: generate \(\{F_i\}\) up to \(N\).  
Phase 2: identify the maximal \(F_i\) that does not exceed the current remainder.  
Phase 3: update the remainder so that it strictly falls below the next candidate index.  
Phase 4: repeat until no resource remains."*

\subsection*{Self‑Consistency}
*"Whichever implementation you choose, if you always (a) precompute the sequence, (b) pick the largest admissible term, and (c) reduce the target into the forbidden zone for the preceding index, you arrive at the same unique decomposition."*

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
*"Reflect on:
- How does generating all \(F_i\le N\) guarantee completeness of choices?
- Why does choosing the maximal admissible \(F_i\) force the remainder below \(F_{i-1}\)?
- How does that gap enforce the non‑consecutive constraint?"*

\subsection*{Chain‑of‑Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
*"Let \(R_0=N\) and \(\{F_1,F_2,\dots\}\) with \(F_i\le N\).  For each step \(t\):
\[
i_t=\max\{\,i:F_i\le R_{t-1}\},\quad
R_t=R_{t-1}-F_{i_t},
\]
noting \(R_t<F_{i_t-1}\) so \(i_{t+1}\le i_t-2\)."*

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item **Generate**: compute all Fibonacci terms \(\le N\).  
  \item **Initialize**: set remainder \(R\leftarrow N\).  
  \item **Iterate**:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item Select the largest term \(F_{i}\le R\).
      \item Reduce \(R\) by exactly that term.
      \item Observe that \(R\) now lies below \(F_{i-1}\), forbidding consecutive use.
    \end{itemize}
  \item **Terminate** when \(R=0\).  
  \item **Result**: collected terms in descending order give the Zeckendorf sum.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
\begin{itemize}
  \item **Action:** Precompute Fibonacci sequence up to \(N\).  
  \item **Reasoning:** These are the only valid summands.  
  \item **Action:** While remainder \(R>0\), pick the largest \(F_i\le R\) and reduce \(R\).  
  \item **Reasoning:** The remainder then falls below the predecessor index, ensuring no two consecutive terms.  
  \item **Conclusion:** The accumulated terms form the unique Zeckendorf decomposition.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
*"Compute all Fibonacci numbers \(\le N\).  Then repeatedly withdraw the largest allowable term from your “budget” \(R\), updating \(R\) so that it inevitably lies below the next smaller Fibonacci.  Continue until \(R=0\).  The sequence of withdrawals, in descending order, is your Zeckendorf representation."*

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
Step 1: Generate the Fibonacci numbers up to 76:
\[
\{1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55\}
\]

Step 2: Use a greedy algorithm to select the largest Fibonacci number \( F \leq R \) at each step, avoiding consecutive Fibonacci numbers:

- \( 55 \leq 76 \Rightarrow \) Select 55  
  Remaining: \( 76 - 55 = 21 \)

- Next Fibonacci \( \leq 21 \): 21  
  \( 21 \leq 21 \Rightarrow \) Select 21  
  Remaining: \( 21 - 21 = 0 \)

No remainder is left.

Final Zeckendorf representation:
\[
76 = 55 + 21
\]
