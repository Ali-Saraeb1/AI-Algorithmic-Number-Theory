\section{Solving Pell’s Equation}
\subsection*{Question}
Find the fundamental solution \((x,y)\) to Pell’s equation
\[
x^2 - 3\,y^2 = 1,
\]
using the continued fraction expansion of \(\sqrt{3}\). Observe that the continued fraction expansion of \(\sqrt{d}\) has an even period length.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
- **Example 1: \(d = 7\)**  
  The continued fraction expansion of \(\sqrt{7}\) is \([2; \overline{1,1,1,4}]\).  
  We observe
  \[
  8^2 - 7\cdot3^2 = 64 - 63 = 1.
  \]  

- **Example 2: \(d = 11\)**  
  The continued fraction expansion of \(\sqrt{11}\) is \([3; \overline{3,6}]\).  
  We observe
  \[
  10^2 - 11\cdot3^2 = 100 - 99 = 1.
  \]  

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
*"Observe that the convergents \(x/y\) not only approximate \(\sqrt{d}\) but satisfy \(x/y \approx \sqrt{d+\frac{1}{y^2}}\). When \(y\) is large, this approximation is close to \(\sqrt{d}\). Use continued fractions."*

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
*"Step by step, consider:
1. Note that \(x/y \approx \sqrt{d+\frac{1}{y^2}}\)
2. Approximate \(\sqrt{d}\) e.g via continued fractions.
3. Verify that the candidate \((x,y)\) satisfies \(x^2 - d\,y^2 = 1\)."*

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
*"Ensure your method is robust by:
- Make sure you understand what continued fractions are.
- Recognizing that \(x^2 - d\,y^2 = 1\) implies \(x/y \approx \sqrt{d+\frac{1}{y^2}}\), and for large \(y\) this approximates \(\sqrt{d}\).
- Comparing your candidate solution with known examples."*

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
*"Reflect on these logical steps:
- The relation \(x^2 - d\,y^2 = 1\) means \(x/y\) is nearly \(\sqrt{d+\frac{1}{y^2}}\) and for large \(y\), close to \(\sqrt{d}\).
- Continued fractions yield excellent approximations of irrational numbers.
- Verify that your solution satisfies the original equation."*

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
*"Express the method symbolically:
- Represent \(\sqrt{d}\) as \([a_0; \overline{a_1, a_2, \dots, a_k}]\) with even \(k\).
- The equation implies \(x/y \approx \sqrt(d) \)"*

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
*"Outline your strategy:
1. **Continued Fraction Expansion:** Compute the expansion of \(\sqrt{d}\).
2. **Observation:** The equation gives \(x/y = \sqrt{d+\frac{1}{y^2}} \approx \sqrt{d}\).
3. **Verification:** Confirm that the candidate solution satisfies the equation.
4. **Output:** Find \((x,y)\)."*

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
*"Proceed with these actions and reasoning:
- **Action:** Compute the continued fraction expansion of \(\sqrt{d}\).
- **Reasoning:** \(x/y \approx \sqrt{d+\frac{1}{y^2}} \approx \sqrt{d} \)), suggesting a candidate.
- **Conclusion:** Finalize the candidate as the solution."*

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
*"For a given nonsquare positive integer \(d\):
1. Compute the continued fraction expansion of \(\sqrt{d}\).
2. \(x/y \approx \sqrt{d+\frac{1}{y^2}}\), which approximates \(\sqrt{d}\) for large \(y\).
3. Verify that the candidate solution satisfies the equation.
4. Return the solution \((x,y)\)."*

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
The continued fraction of \(\sqrt{3}\) is
\[
\sqrt{3} = [\,1;\overline{1,2}\,],
\]
so its periodic part has length \(2\).  The convergents \(\frac{h_n}{k_n}\) are:
\[
\frac{h_0}{k_0} = \frac{1}{1},\quad
\frac{h_1}{k_1} = \frac{2}{1},\quad
\frac{h_2}{k_2} = \frac{5}{3},\;\dots
\]
Since the period is even, the fundamental solution \((x,y)\) is given by the convergent at index \(n=1\):
\[
(x,y) = (h_1,k_1) = (2,1).
\]
Check:
\[
2^2 - 3\cdot1^2 = 4 - 3 = 1.
\]
Thus the fundamental solution is 
\[
\boxed{(x,y) = (2,1)}.
