\section{Greedy Egyptian Fractions Algorithm}
\subsection*{Question}
Express the rational number 4/13 as a sum of distinct unit fractions (i.e., in Egyptian fraction form) using a greedy strategy.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
Reflect on how some representations of rational numbers as sums of unit fractions can be constructed by repeatedly choosing a suitable candidate fraction. Consider which properties of a unit fraction might make it a natural choice at each stage.

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
"Think about the structure of a positive rational number and the characteristics of unit fractions. Ask yourself: is there a way to choose one unit fraction that, when removed from the number, leaves a simpler rational number?"

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
"Step-by-step:
1. Analyze the given rational number to identify a candidate unit fraction that is 'just right' for the current value.
2. Update the remaining fraction after removing the chosen candidate.
3. Repeat the process until the remainder is reduced to zero."

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
"Ensure your method:
- Chooses a candidate unit fraction based on a property intrinsic to the current fraction.
- Always results in a remainder that is still positive and simplifies the problem.
- Terminates in a finite number of steps."

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
"Ask: what condition must a unit fraction meet in order to be a valid candidate at each step? Consider whether a rounding strategy or a minimal threshold could naturally suggest a candidate without testing every possibility."

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
"Express the idea symbolically:
- Identify a function of the current numerator and denominator that leads to a candidate denominator.
- Use this candidate to define a new, smaller fraction.
- Repeat until the entire fraction is decomposed."

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
"Outline your strategy:
1. **Candidate Selection:** Devise a way to choose a unit fraction that is compatible with the current fraction.
2. **Fraction Update:** Determine how to update the fraction after choosing the candidate.
3. **Iteration:** Repeat these steps until the process is complete, ensuring each step moves you closer to a full representation."

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
"Proceed with these steps:
- **Action:** Determine a condition or operation that singles out a candidate unit fraction.
- **Reasoning:** Check that this candidate can be subtracted without making the remaining fraction negative.
- **Action:** Update the fraction and simplify if needed.
- **Outcome:** Continue until the full Egyptian fraction representation is achieved."

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
"For a given positive rational number:
1. Develop a method to identify a unit fraction candidate based on the current fraction.
2. Update the fraction after subtracting this candidate.
3. Continue this process until the fraction is completely expressed as a sum of unit fractions.
4. Return the list of denominators corresponding to these unit fractions."

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
We apply the greedy Egyptian fraction algorithm to the rational number 4/13.

Step 1:
Find the smallest integer x such that 1/x ≤ 4/13. We compute ceil(13/4) = 4. So, the first unit fraction is 1/4.

Subtracting 1/4 from 4/13:
4/13 - 1/4 = (4*4 - 13*1)/(13*4) = (16 - 13)/52 = 3/52

Step 2:
Now we apply the algorithm to 3/52.
ceil(52/3) = 18 ⇒ next unit fraction is 1/18

3/52 - 1/18 = (3*18 - 52*1)/(52*18) = (54 - 52)/936 = 2/936 = 1/468

Step 3:
Apply the algorithm to 1/468. This is already a unit fraction.

Final Egyptian fraction representation:
4/13 = 1/4 + 1/18 + 1/468
