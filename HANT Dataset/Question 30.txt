\section{Decomposition of a Prime Ideal in a Quadratic Number Field}
\subsection*{Question}
Determine how the ideal \(( 3 )\) decomposes in the ring \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}) \). Your solution should decide whether \((p)\) splits into two distinct prime ideals, remains inert, or is ramified. 

\textbf{Definitions}
- **Quadratic Field:** A field of the form \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) where \(d\) is squarefree.
- **Ring of Integers \(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})}\):**  
  \(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})}\) is:
  - \(\mathbb{Z}[\sqrt{d}]\) if \(d \not\equiv 1 \mod 4\),
  - \(\mathbb{Z}\left[\frac{1+\sqrt{d}}{2}\right]\) if \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\).
- **Field Discriminant (\(\Delta\)):**  
  Determined by:
  - \(\Delta = 4d\) if \(d \not\equiv 1 \mod 4\),
  - \(\Delta = d\) if \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\).
- **Quadratic Residue:** An integer \(a\) is a quadratic residue modulo \(p\) if there exists an integer \(x\) such that \(x^2 \equiv a \pmod{p}\).

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
Consider these brief examples
- **Example 1:**  
  In a quadratic field with \(d = -7\) and \(p = 3\), observe how the discriminant \(\Delta\) guides the behavior of \((p)\).
- **Example 2:**  When \(d = 13\) (with \(13 \equiv 1 \bmod 4\), so \(\Delta = 13\)) and \(p = 7\), reflect on how the quadratic‚Äêresidue status of \(\Delta\) modulo \(p\) influences whether the prime ideal \((p)\) splits in \(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})}\) or remains inert.


\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
*"Start by determining the field discriminant from \(d\). Ask yourself whether \(p\) is linked to this discriminant (for instance, if \(p\) divides it). If not, use your understanding of quadratic residues to infer the splitting behavior of \((p)\). Let your reasoning guide you toward a classification of \((p)\)."*

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
*"Step by step, consider:
1. How to calculate the field discriminant based on \(d\).
2. What the consequences are if \(p\) divides the discriminant.
3. How the concept of quadratic residues applies when \(p\) does not divide \(\Delta\).
4. How these elements come together to determine if \((p)\) splits or remains inert."*

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
*"Double-check your method by ensuring:
- The discriminant is computed correctly from \(d\).
- A distinct check is made for the case where \(p\) divides \(\Delta\).
- Quadratic residue analysis is used appropriately in the remaining scenario.
- The final decision distinguishes between splitting, inert, and ramified cases."*

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
*"Reflect on these points:
- The discriminant \(\Delta\) encapsulates key arithmetic properties of the field.
- Divisibility of \(\Delta\) by \(p\) signals a fundamentally different behavior (ramification).
- In the absence of such divisibility, the quadratic residue status of \(\Delta\) modulo \(p\) hints at whether \((p)\) splits or remains inert.
- Organize your reasoning so that each observation naturally leads to the next step."*

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
*"Denote symbolically:
- \(\Delta = \begin{cases} d, & d \equiv 1 \mod 4 \\ 4d, & \text{otherwise} \end{cases}\).
- Recognize \(p \mid \Delta\) indicates a ramified ideal.
- Use a symbolic marker for the quadratic residue status of \(\Delta\) modulo \(p\) to inform the final categorization."*

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
*"Outline your plan:
1. **Discriminant Calculation:** Derive \(\Delta\) from \(d\).
2. **Ramification Check:** Verify if \(p\) divides \(\Delta\); if so, classify \((p)\) as ramified.
3. **Residue Analysis:** For primes not dividing \(\Delta\), consider the quadratic residue properties of \(\Delta\) modulo \(p\).
4. **Final Classification:** Integrate these insights to decide whether \((p)\) splits or is inert."*

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
*"Proceed by:
- **Action:** Computing the discriminant from \(d\).
- **Reasoning:** The discriminant is crucial for the behavior of the ideal.
- **Action:** Checking if \(p\) divides the discriminant.
- **Reasoning:** This leads to one distinct case.
- **Action:** For the other scenario, evaluating the quadratic residue relation of \(\Delta\) modulo \(p\).
- **Conclusion:** Use your findings to classify the decomposition of \((p)\)."*

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
*"For given squarefree \(d\) and an odd prime \(p\):
1. Compute the discriminant \(\Delta\) of \(\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})\) as follows:
   - If \(d \equiv 1 \mod 4\), then \(\Delta = d\);
   - Otherwise, \(\Delta = 4d\).
2. Use divisibility or non divisibility of \(\Delta\) by \(p\) and the quadratic residue behavior of \(\Delta\) modulo \(p\) 
3. Conclude with the correct classification of \((p)\) in \(\mathcal{O}_{\mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{d})}\)."*

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
Step 1: Compute the field discriminant.
Since \( 5 \equiv 1 \mod 4 \), we use \( \Delta = 5 \).
Step 2: Check if \( p \mid \Delta \).
Here, \( 3 \mid 5 \) is false.
Step 3: Since \( 3 \nmid 5 \), check whether \( \Delta = 5 \) is a quadratic residue modulo \( 3 \).
Compute \( 2^{(3-1)/2} \mod 3 = 2 (non-residue) \).
Therefore, \(( 3 )\) is \textbf{inert} in \( \mathbb{Q}(\sqrt{5}) \).
