\section{Elliptic Curve Point Multiplication via Double-and-Add Algorithm}

\subsection*{Question}
Let \(E\) be an elliptic curve over the finite field \(\mathbb{F}_p\) defined by
\[
y^2 = x^3 + ax + b,
\]
and let \(P = (x, y)\) be a point on \(E\). For a positive integer \(n\), design an algorithm to compute the scalar multiplication \(nP\) (i.e., summing \(P\) with itself \(n\) times) using a double-and-add strategy. Your algorithm should leverage the binary representation of \(n\) to determine the sequence of operations on \(P\) without exposing all internal computational details.

\textbf{Technical Definitions:}
- **Elliptic Curve \(E\):** The set of points \((x,y) \in \mathbb{F}_p^2\) satisfying \(y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\), along with an identity element \(\mathcal{O}\) (the point at infinity).
- **Point Doubling:** An operation that computes \(2P\) for a given point \(P\) on \(E\) using a formula derived from the curve's tangent.
- **Point Addition:** The operation that computes \(P + Q\) for two distinct points \(P\) and \(Q\) on \(E\) via the chord-and-tangent method.
- **Scalar Multiplication:** The computation of \(nP\) by repeated application of point doubling and point addition.
- **Double-and-Add Algorithm:** A method that expresses \(n\) in a form which guides an iterative process that combines operations in a systematic way, thus reducing the number of arithmetic steps.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
Reflect on these observations:
- When \(n\) is expressed in a compact numeral system (e.g., binary), it becomes apparent how the computation of \(nP\) may be decomposed into a series of smaller, repeatable operations.
- An effective strategy minimizes redundant computations by determining at each step whether to combine an additional contribution from \(P\).

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
\textit{Consider representing the scalar \(n\) in a structured numeral system to expose its intrinsic composition. Initialize an accumulator with the identity element of the elliptic curve. Then, iteratively update the accumulator using a fixed rule, conditionally incorporating the point \(P\) based on the structure of \(n\). Conclude by verifying that the resultant point lies on the curve \(E\).}

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
\textit{Proceed step by step:
1. Express \(n\) in a numeral system that makes its structure explicit.
2. Initialize a result variable with the identity element of \(E\).
3. For each component of the numeral representation, update the result using a predefined operation.
4. Under appropriate conditions (determined by the numeral structure), modify the result by incorporating \(P\).
5. Validate that the final result satisfies the elliptic curve equation.}

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
\textit{Ensure your method:
- Utilizes a numeral representation of \(n\) that guides the iterative process efficiently.
- Applies a consistent operation at each step, with a conditional modification that preserves correctness.
- Verifies at every step that the intermediate result remains a valid point on \(E\).}

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
\textit{Reflect on the reasoning:
- A numeral representation of \(n\) helps structure the computation into repeatable steps.
- At each step, a fixed operation is applied, with a conditional modification guided by the numeral system.
- The final result must be checked against the curve equation to ensure correctness.}

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
\textit{Express the approach symbolically:
Let 
\[
n = (d_k d_{k-1} \dots d_0),
\]
where the digits \(d_i\) guide the process. Initialize \(R = \mathcal{O}\). For each digit \(d_i\), update \(R\) using a uniform rule and, when a specific condition is met by \(d_i\), further update \(R\) by combining it with \(P\). The final \(R\) represents \(nP\).}

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
\textit{Outline your strategy:
1. \textbf{Representation:} Convert \(n\) into a structured numeral form.
2. \textbf{Initialization:} Set the accumulator \(R\) to the identity element \(\mathcal{O}\).
3. \textbf{Iteration:} For each digit in the representation:
   - Apply a standard update to \(R\).
   - Conditionally modify \(R\) by incorporating \(P\) based on the digit.
4. \textbf{Verification:} Confirm that the final point satisfies the curve equation \(y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\).
5. \textbf{Output:} Return \(R\) as the computed \(nP\).}

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
\textit{Follow these steps:
- \textbf{Action:} Represent \(n\) in a numeral system that clarifies its structure.
- \textbf{Reasoning:} The structure of \(n\) indicates when to include an extra contribution from \(P\).
- \textbf{Action:} Iteratively update an accumulator using a fixed operation.
- \textbf{Action:} Conditionally modify the accumulator by incorporating \(P\) as dictated by the numeral system.
- \textbf{Conclusion:} Verify that the final point lies on \(E\) before returning it.}

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
\textit{For the elliptic curve \(E\) and the point \(P\):
1. Express the scalar \(n\) in a structured numeral representation.
2. Initialize an accumulator with the identity element \(\mathcal{O}\) of \(E\).
3. For each digit in the numeral representation:
   - Apply a consistent update to the accumulator.
   - Conditionally combine the accumulator with \(P\) based on the digit.
4. Verify that the final computed point satisfies \(y^2 = x^3 + ax + b\).
5. Return the final point as \(nP\).}
