\section{Chinese Remainder Theorem for Two Congruences}
\subsection*{Question}
Let \(m_1\) and \(m_2\) be two positive integers with \(\gcd(m_1, m_2)=1\). For given integers \(a\) and \(b\), devise an algorithm to compute a unique integer \(x\) satisfying
\[
\begin{aligned}
x &\equiv a \pmod{m_1},\\[1mm]
x &\equiv b \pmod{m_2},
\end{aligned}
\]
with the result taken modulo \(N = m_1 \cdot m_2\). Your solution should combine the two congruences into one.

\subsection*{Hints}


\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
Consider these simple instances:
### Example 1
  \( x \equiv 2 \pmod{3}, \quad x \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \)

**Solution:**  
  \( x = 2 + 3k \), then substituting into the second congruence:  
  \( 2 + 3k \equiv 3 \pmod{5} \), so  
  \( 3k \equiv 1 \pmod{5} \).  
  Thus,  
  \( k \equiv 2 \pmod{5} \), so \( k = 2 + 5t \).  
  Thus,  
  \( x = 2 + 3(2 + 5t) = 8 + 15t \).  
  Thus,  
  \( x \equiv 8 \pmod{15} \).

---

### Example 2 
  \( x \equiv 1 \pmod{4}, \quad x \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \)

- **Solution:**  
  \( x = 1 + 4k \), then substituting into the second congruence:  
  \( 1 + 4k \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), so  
  \( 4k \equiv 1 \pmod{7} \).  
  Thus,
  \( k \equiv 2 \pmod{7} \), so \( k = 2 + 7t \).  
  Thus,  
  \( x = 1 + 4(2 + 7t) = 9 + 28t \).  
  Thus,
  \( x \equiv 9 \pmod{28} \).

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
"Notice that from the first congruence, one can express \(x\) as an equation. Use the second equation."

---

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
"Step by step, ask:
1. How can you express \(x\) based on the first congruence?
2. Use the second equation.
3. How does this help you construct the unique solution \(x\) modulo \(m_1 \cdot m_2\)?"

---

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
"Keep in mind:
- The representation of \(x\) from the first congruence is key.
- Use the second equation
- Solving this reduced equation should yield a value that, when substituted back, gives an \(x\) satisfying both congruences."

---

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
"Reflect on the following:
- By expressing \(x\) in terms of \(a\) and an integer multiple of \(m_1\), you naturally incorporate the first condition.
-Use the second equation.
- The overall strategy ensures that the final candidate \(x\) meets both congruences."

---

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
"Summarize the idea symbolically:
- Write \(x \) in an equation in integers.
- Use the second equation.
- Use the resulting relation to determine \(k\) modulo \(m_2\), thereby yielding \(x\) modulo \(m_1 m_2\)."

---

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
"Outline your conceptual approach:
1. **Express \(x\):** Begin by writing \(x\) in an equation in \( Z \) (the integers).
2. Use the second equation.
3. **Reconstruct:**Express your answer modulo \(m_1 \cdot m_2\)."

---

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
"Proceed with these steps:
- **Reasoning:** How can we represent \(x\) as an equation in terms of \(m_1 \)?
- **Action:** Use the second equation.
- **Conclusion:** Construct \(x\) modulo \(m_1 \cdot m_2\)."

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
"For the system
\[
x \equiv a \pmod{m_1} \quad \text{and} \quad x \equiv b \pmod{m_2},
\]
with \(\gcd(m_1, m_2) = 1\):
1. Consider expressing \(x\) in term \(m_1\).
2. Use the second equation.
3. Ensure the final result is presented modulo \(m_1 \cdot m_2\).
