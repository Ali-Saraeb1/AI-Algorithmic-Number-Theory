\section{Fermat Factorization Method}
\subsection*{Question}
Factorize the odd integer \(N= 35 \) using an alternative method to direct trial division. Your task is to discover a pair of factors by uncovering a hidden numerical structure within \(N\). Show all steps of your work.


\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
Consider these examples:
- **Example 1:** For \(N=15\), notice that \(4^2 - 1^2 = 16 - 1 = 15\). Hence, the factors are \(4-1=3\) and \(4+1=5\).
- **Example 2:** For \(N=21\), observe that \(5^2 - 2^2 = 25 - 4 = 21\), giving factors \(5-2=3\) and \(5+2=7\).

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
Let \(x\) be an integer satisfying
\[
x \ge \sqrt{N}.
\]
Investigate the numerical gap defined by the difference between \(x^2\) and \(N\). Determine under what conditions this gap possesses a structural property that allows it to be exactly decomposed using a classical quadratic transformation, without revealing the explicit decomposition.


\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
Proceed as follows:
1. Initialize \(x_0 = \lceil \sqrt{N} \rceil\).
2. For each candidate \(x \ge x_0\), compute the gap \(g(x)\) (the difference between \(x^2\) and \(N\)).
3. Check if \(g(x)\) exhibits the necessary structural signature.
4. If not, increment \(x\) and repeat until the signature is observed.

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
Ensure that:
- The candidate \(x\) is chosen such that \(x^2 \ge N\).
- Once the condition is met, a classical quadratic method is used to derive factors whose product equals \(N\).

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
- Recall the identity 
\[
x^2 - y^2 = (x-y)(x+y).
\]

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
Express the method symbolically:
- Choose \(x\) such that \(x \ge \sqrt{N}\).
- Let \(g(x)\) denote the gap computed from \(x^2\) and \(N\).
- When \(g(x)\) manifests the necessary structural signature.

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
Outline your strategy:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Set \(x_0^2 \ge N\).
    \item For each \(x = x_0, x_0+1, x_0+2, \dots\), compute the gap \(g(x)\).
    \item Identify the first \(x\) for which \(g(x)\) meets the necessary structural signature.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
Proceed with these steps:
- **Action:** Set \(x\) as the smallest integer such that \(x^2 \ge N\).
- **Reasoning:** This choice guarantees that the computed gap \(g(x)\) is nonnegative.
- **Action:** Evaluate \(g(x)\) and check for the required structural signature.

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
For any odd integer \(N\):
1. Define \(x \ge  \lceil \sqrt{N} \rceil\) and compute the gap \(g(x)\).
2. Determine whether \(g(x)\) exhibits the necessary structural signature.
3. If not, increment \(x\) and repeat.
4. Deduce and return the factors of \(N\).

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
Step 1: Determine the starting value for x.
- Calculate √35 ≈ 5.92, so set x = 6 (the smallest integer greater than or equal to √35).

Step 2: Compute y².
- Compute y² = x² - 35 = 6² - 35 = 36 - 35 = 1.

Step 3: Check if y² is a perfect square.
- Since 1 is a perfect square (1 = 1²), set y = 1.

Step 4: Determine the factors.
- The factors are given by (x - y) and (x + y), which are 6 - 1 = 5 and 6 + 1 = 7.

Final Answer:
The factors of 35 are 5 and 7.
