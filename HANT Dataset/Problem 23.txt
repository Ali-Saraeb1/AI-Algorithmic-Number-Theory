\section{Computing the Binary GCD (Stein’s) Algorithm Using Even–Odd Properties}

\subsection*{Question}
Given two nonnegative integers \(a\) and \(b\), design an algorithm that computes their greatest common divisor (gcd) using only tests for even/odd, subtraction, and halving (shifts).  This Binary GCD (Stein’s) method relies on parity‑driven simplifications and a final recombination.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few‑Shot Hinting}
Try these pairs by hand and look for a small, parity‑based move that reduces their size without changing their gcd:
\[
(4,2),\quad (9,3),\quad (5,12),\quad (15,6).
\]
What uniform transformation applies when both share parity?  When they differ?  When both are odd?

\subsection*{Chain‑of‑Thought (CoT) Prompting}
*"Begin with trivial endpoints (\(a=0\) or \(b=0\)).  Then at each step:
1. Inspect whether \(a\) and \(b\) share the same parity or not.
2. Choose a simple parity‑based update or a difference‑based move.
3. Ensure each move strictly reduces \(\max(a,b)\) while preserving \(\gcd(a,b)\).
Repeat until one value vanishes."*

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
*"Outline:
1. Handle zeros.
2. Loop:
   - Use parity tests to select one of two reduction rules.
   - Apply the rule that shrinks the larger argument.
3. End when one argument is zero; return the other."*

\subsection*{Self‑Consistency}
Every transformation—whether a parity alignment or an odd‑odd subtraction—must keep the gcd invariant and strictly decrease a size measure, guaranteeing termination.

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
*"Reflect:
- Which parity pattern triggers which reduction?
- How does your chosen step guarantee the larger of \((a,b)\) decreases?
- Why does this process always terminate with the correct gcd?"*

\subsection*{Chain‑of‑Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
*"Let \(\pi(x)\) denote parity.  Then define a map
\[
(a,b)\;\mapsto\;(a',b')
\]
so that  
\[
\pi(a'),\pi(b')\in\{\text{even},\text{odd}\},
\quad
\max(a',b')<\max(a,b),
\quad
\gcd(a',b')=\gcd(a,b).
\]
Iterate until one coordinate is zero."*

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
\begin{enumerate}
  \item **Base:** if \(a=0\) or \(b=0\), return the other.
  \item **Parity Phase:** if \(a,b\) share parity, apply a paired reduction.
  \item **Alignment Phase:** otherwise, apply a parity‑alignment step.
  \item **Reduction Phase:** when both are odd, apply a size‑reducing subtraction.
  \item **Repeat** until one argument vanishes.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
\begin{itemize}
  \item **Action:** Check for zero arguments.  
    **Reasoning:** Trivial gcd.
  \item **Action:** Test parities of \(a\) and \(b\).  
    **Reasoning:** Parity guides which reduction preserves gcd.
  \item **Action:** Apply the selected parity‑driven or subtraction rule.  
    **Reasoning:** Each rule reduces the larger argument.
  \item **Conclusion:** When one argument is zero, the other is the gcd.
\end{itemize}

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
*"Iterate until one input is zero by alternating:
- a parity‑alignment move when parities differ,
- a paired reduction when they match,
- and a subtraction‑based reduction when both are odd.
Each move preserves the gcd and reduces the problem size.  The nonzero remainder is the gcd."*

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
Below is an implementation of the Binary GCD (Stein’s) Algorithm in Python. The code uses even/odd tests, subtraction, and halving (via shifts) to compute the gcd.

\begin{lstlisting}[language=Python]
def binary_gcd(a, b):
    # Base cases: if one number is zero, return the other.
    if a == 0:
        return b
    if b == 0:
        return a

    # Step 1: Remove all common factors of 2.
    # Count how many times both numbers are even.
    factor = 0
    while (a % 2 == 0) and (b % 2 == 0):
        a //= 2  # Divide a by 2 (allowed because a is even)
        b //= 2  # Divide b by 2 (allowed because b is even)
        factor += 1

    # Step 2: Make sure a is odd.
    while a % 2 == 0:
        a //= 2

    # Step 3: Reduce the pair (both numbers now have at least one odd).
    while b != 0:
        # Ensure b is odd.
        while b % 2 == 0:
            b //= 2
        # Now, both a and b are odd.
        # Replace the larger with the absolute difference.
        if a > b:
            a, b = b, a  # Swap so that a is always the smaller.
        b = b - a  # The difference is even.
    
    # Step 4: Reintroduce the common factors of 2.
    return a * (2 ** factor)
