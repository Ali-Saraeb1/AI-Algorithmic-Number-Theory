\section{Primality Testing via Trial Division}
\subsection*{Question}
Determine whether 
\[
n = 29
\]
is prime by using trial division. The output should be “yes” if \( n \) is prime and “no” if it is composite.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
Consider these cases to guide your thinking without revealing the full solution:
- **Case 1:** For a very small number (e.g. the smallest prime), note that its uniqueness can be quickly verified.
- **Case 2:** For a composite number such as one with an obvious small factor, think about how testing only a limited range of numbers can reveal its non-prime nature.
- **Case 3:** For a number that is prime, observe that careful inspection within a bounded set of potential factors shows no divisor exists.

The key idea is to limit your search for divisors to a range that is sufficient to capture any possible factors without checking every number.

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
*"Recognize that any nontrivial divisor of \( n \) must lie below a certain threshold. Reflect on why the structure of factors implies that a complete check need only cover numbers up to that limit, ensuring you can conclude primality without exhaustive testing."*

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
*"Step by step, consider:
1. Identify the logical bound beyond which no new factor information is necessary.
2. Use this boundary to narrow down the set of potential divisors.
3. Conclude about the primality of \( n \) based on whether a divisor is found within this restricted set."*

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
*"Make sure your reasoning holds by:
- Confirming that the chosen range of divisors is sufficient to conclude whether \( n \) is prime.
- Checking your method on a variety of numbers (both prime and composite) to ensure consistent conclusions."*

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
*"Ask yourself: If \( n \) had a factor beyond a certain point, what would that imply about the corresponding factor? Use this logical insight to limit your divisor search and thereby efficiently decide the primality of \( n \)."*

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
*"Express the insight symbolically:
- Think of \( n \) as prime if there is no divisor \( d \) within a specific range (determined by the properties of \( n \)) for which \( n \mod d = 0 \).
- The challenge is to identify this critical range without needing to test every candidate."*

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
*"Outline your approach:
1. Determine a theoretical limit based on the properties of factors.
2. Restrict your testing to potential divisors within this boundary.
3. Decide on the primality of \( n \) by checking whether any candidate within the range divides \( n \) evenly."*

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
*"Proceed with these actions and reasoning:
- **Action:** Establish the range of numbers that must be examined.
- **Reasoning:** The structure of factors means that if a divisor exists, it must be found within this limited set.
- **Action:** Check for divisibility only within this range.
- **Conclusion:** Conclude about the primality of \( n \) based on the outcome of these checks."*

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
*"For a given integer \( n > 1 \):
1. Determine a sufficient bound within which any nontrivial divisor of \( n \) must lie.
2. Test \( n \) for divisibility by numbers in this restricted range.
3. Return “yes” if no divisor is found, and “no” if a divisor is discovered."*

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
First compute
\[
\lfloor \sqrt{29}\rfloor = 5.
\]
We test divisibility of \(29\) by each integer \(d = 2,3,4,5\):
\[
29 \bmod 2 = 1,\quad
29 \bmod 3 = 2,\quad
29 \bmod 4 = 1,\quad
29 \bmod 5 = 4.
\]
None of these remainders is \(0\), so \(29\) has no nontrivial divisor up to \(\sqrt{29}\).  Therefore,
\[
\boxed{\text{yes}}
\]
— \(29\) is prime.
