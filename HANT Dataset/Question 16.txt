\section{Linear Congruence Solver}
\subsection*{Question}
Solve the linear congruence \( 2x \equiv 4 (mod 6) \). Determine all integers x that satisfy the congruence.

That is, determine all integers \(x\) satisfying the congruence, or state that no solution exists.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}

- **Example 1: \(2x \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\)**  
  Begin by computing \(\gcd(2,6) = 2\). Observe that the right-hand side \(4\) is divisible by this gcd. Consider reducing the congruence by this factor. What new modulus results, and how can you find a value of \(x\) satisfying the simplified congruence?

- **Example 2: \(3x \equiv 4 \pmod{6}\)**  
  Here, \(\gcd(3,6) = 3\), but 3 does not divide 4. Reflect on whether this congruence can have a solution, and if not, why this divisibility condition is essential.

- **Example 3: \(4x \equiv 6 \pmod{10}\)**  
  Compute \(\gcd(4,10) = 2\), and note that 2 divides 6. Reduce the equation accordingly. What modulus and coefficient result from this simplification? How might you proceed from there to find a valid solution?

- **Example 4: \(5x \equiv 0 \pmod{15}\)**  
  Since the right-hand side is 0, the congruence becomes homogeneous. Think about when such congruences have nontrivial solutions and how many distinct congruence classes of solutions exist.

- **Example 5: \(7x \equiv 1 \pmod{13}\)**  
  Observe that \(\gcd(7,13) = 1\), so the congruence should be solvable. What general principle ensures that such congruences have a unique solution modulo the modulus?

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
*“To determine whether a congruence of the form \(ax \equiv b \pmod{n}\) is solvable, start by considering the divisibility by \(\gcd(a,n)\). If solvable, explore how the problem reduces to a simpler congruence where the coefficient of \(x\) is coprime to a smaller modulus. Then reflect on how such reduced equations are typically handled in number theory.”*

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
*"Step by step:
1. Consider whether the original congruence can be solved at all—what condition must hold?
2. If the condition is satisfied, ask: how can the equation be simplified?
3. Once simplified, how can a valid residue class of solutions be obtained?
4. Finally, how might the solution set be characterized modulo the original modulus?"*

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
*“Your reasoning should align with basic number-theoretic principles:
- The greatest common divisor of the coefficient and modulus is an important quantity for existence and derivation.
- That the solution set, when it exists, forms a full residue class modulo a predictable modulus.”*

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
*“Reframe the congruence \(ax \equiv b \pmod{n}\) as the equation \(ax - ny = b\), a linear Diophantine equation in two variables. Consider when such equations are known to have integer solutions. Then, think about how one constructs a particular solution and describes the entire solution set using arithmetic properties.”*

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
*Let \(g = \gcd(a,n)\). Decide on the existence of the solution.  
Then examine the simplified congruence \(a'x \equiv b' \pmod{n'}\).*  

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
*Organize your strategy as:
1. **Check Solvability:** Consider \(\gcd(a,n)\).
2. **Simplify:** Simplify the equation.
3. **Solve Reduced Form:** Consider how such simplified congruences can be handled using standard number-theoretic tools.
4. **Describe All Solutions:** Think about how to reconstruct the full set of solutions modulo \(n\) from the simplified form.*  

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
**Reasoning:** The solvability of a linear congruence depends on whether a certain divisor condition is satisfied.  
**Action:** Compute \(\gcd(a,n)\).  
**Reasoning:** The congruence can be simplified.  
**Action:** Reduce the equation and apply a conceptual method (e.g., Euclidean or modular reasoning) to handle the simplified case.  
**Reasoning:** Use arithmetic structure to understand how all solutions are derived from one.

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
*“To solve \(ax \equiv b \pmod{n}\):
1. Compute the greatest common divisor \(g = \gcd(a,n)\).
2. Decide if a solution exists.
3. If possible, simplify the equation.
4. Use structural reasoning to identify how the solutions to the reduced congruence inform the solution set of the original.”*

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
Step 1: Compute the greatest common divisor.
- gcd(2, 6) = 2.

Step 2: Check for solvability.
- Since 2 divides 4, the congruence has a solution.

Step 3: Simplify the congruence by dividing by the gcd.
- Dividing both sides of \( 2x \equiv 4 (mod 6) \) by 2 gives:
  \( x \equiv 2 (mod 3) \).

Step 4: Describe the general solution.
- The solution set is all integers of the form:
  x = 2 + 3k, where k is any integer.

Final Answer:
All integers x = 2 + 3k (with k in Z, integer) are solutions to \( 2x \equiv 4 (mod 6)\)
