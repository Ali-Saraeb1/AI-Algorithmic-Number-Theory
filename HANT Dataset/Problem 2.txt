\section{2. Greatest Common Divisor (Euclid’s Algorithm)}
\subsection*{Question}
Given two positive integers $a$ and $b$, compute their greatest common divisor (GCD), which is the largest integer that divides both $a$ and $b$.

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}

Consider the following worked-out examples using the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD:

**Example 1: GCD(48, 18)**

1. **First Step**: Compute the remainder of 48 divided by 18:
   - 48 ÷ 18 = 2 with a remainder of 12 (since 48 - 2 × 18 = 12).
   - Thus, GCD(48, 18) = GCD(18, 12).

2. **Second Step**: Compute the remainder of 18 divided by 12:
   - 18 ÷ 12 = 1 with a remainder of 6 (since 18 - 1 × 12 = 6).
   - Thus, GCD(18, 12) = GCD(12, 6).

3. **Third Step**: Compute the remainder of 12 divided by 6:
   - 12 ÷ 6 = 2 with a remainder of 0 (since 12 - 2 × 6 = 0).
   - Thus, GCD(12, 6) = GCD(6, 0).

Since the remainder is now 0, the algorithm terminates, and the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 6.

**Example 2: GCD(60, 48)**

1. **First Step**: Compute the remainder of 60 divided by 48:
   - 60 ÷ 48 = 1 with a remainder of 12 (since 60 - 1 × 48 = 12).
   - Thus, GCD(60, 48) = GCD(48, 12).

2. **Second Step**: Compute the remainder of 48 divided by 12:
   - 48 ÷ 12 = 4 with a remainder of 0 (since 48 - 4 × 12 = 0).
   - Thus, GCD(48, 12) = GCD(12, 0).

Since the remainder is now 0, the algorithm terminates, and the GCD is the last non-zero remainder, which is 12.

These examples illustrate how the Euclidean algorithm simplifies the GCD computation by repeatedly replacing the larger number with the remainder of the division until a remainder of zero is achieved.

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}

Start with the larger number. Compute its remainder when divided by the smaller number. Continue until reaching a simple termination condition based on the remainder.

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}

Let's think step by step:

- Compute the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number.
- Repeat the process until the remainder is zero.
- Decide what the GCD is.

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}

Try computing the GCD in multiple ways:

- Using the Euclidean algorithm.
- Listing out divisors explicitly.
- Applying the algorithm recursively.

Compare the results—do they always match?

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}

Check whether each step preserves the GCD. If `d` divides both `a` and `b`, does it also divide their difference? How can we use that?

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}

Express the process using symbols:

- Let \( g = \gcd(a, b) \).
- Let's reduce a \mod b.
- Continue applying this rule until one term is zero.

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}

Think in terms of control flow:

- While loop runs while `b ≠ 0`.
- Inside the loop, think of replacing a and b with two integers less than or equal themselves without changing the GCD
- Stop when `b = 0` and return `a`.

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}

ReAct Prompting combines reasoning with actions to guide the problem-solving process. For computing the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, the steps are:

1. **Action**: Compute the remainder of the larger number divided by the smaller number.
2. **Reasoning**: What can we say about the new numbers we have?
3. **Conclusion**: The GCD is related to the remainder remainder.

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}

Providing explicit instructions enhances clarity and guides the problem-solving process effectively. For the Euclidean algorithm:

1. **Initialization**: Given two integers, \( a \) and \( b \), with \( a > b \).
2. **Division**: Compute the remainder \( r \) when \( a \) is divided by \( b \): \( r = a \mod b \).
4. **Think**: How can we simplify the problem using \(r \)
5. **Termination**: When does repeating the above steps become redundant?.
