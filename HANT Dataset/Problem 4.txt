\section{4. Continued Fraction Expansion}

\subsection*{Question}
Given a real number \( \alpha \), design an algorithm to compute its continued fraction expansion:

\[
\alpha = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \frac{1}{a_3 + \dots}}}.
\]

Generate the sequence \( [a_0, a_1, a_2, \dots] \) and stop when the fractional part becomes zero (for rationals) or when a maximum number of iterations is reached (for irrationals).

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
**Example 1: Find the continued fraction of \( \frac{4}{3} \)**  
1. **First Step**: The integer part of \( \frac{4}{3} \) is 1, so \( a_0 = 1 \).  
2. **Second Step**: \( \frac{4}{3}= 1 + \frac{1}{3} \).  
3. **Third Step**: Can we repeat?

**Example 2: Find the continued fraction of \( \sqrt{2} \)**  
1. **First Step**: The integer part of \( \sqrt{2} \approx 1.414 \) is 1, so \( a_0 = 1 \).  
2. **Second Step**: \( \sqrt{2}= 1+  0.414 \).  
3. **Third Step**: How can we make use of fractions to repeat the first two steps?


\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
1. **Start**: Identify the integer part of \( \alpha \).
2. **Separate**: Rewrite \( \alpha \) 
3. **Invert**: How can we make use of fractions to repeat the first two steps?
4. **Repeat**: Continue until the fractional part is negligible or a maximum iteration count is reached.
5. **Assemble**: The collected 

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
1. **Extract the integer part** of \( \alpha \) to get \( a_0 \).
2. **Determine the fractional part** rewriting \( \alpha \).
3. **If the fraction is non-zero**, consider how to repeat the process.
4. **Iterate** until you reach a clear stopping condition.

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
To check consistency, verify that the continued fraction expansion correctly approximates the input number by reconstructing the number from the expansion and checking if it matches the original number.

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
1. Start by recognizing that any real number can be represented as a continued fraction.
2. The process of repeatedly extracting the integer part and rewriting the number in terms of fractions.
3. Each iteration brings the approximation closer to the true value of \( \alpha \).

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
1. Express the continued fraction expansion symbolically as:

\[
\alpha = a_0 + \frac{1}{a_1 + \frac{1}{a_2 + \dots}}.
\]

2. Start with \( a_0 = \lfloor \alpha \rfloor \).
3. Proceed

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
1. **Initialization**: Set your starting number \( \alpha \).
2. **Iteration Loop**:
  - Compute \( a = \lfloor \alpha \rfloor \).
  - Rewrite \( \alpha \) in terms of fraction to repeat the process. 
3. **Termination**: End the loop when the process can not be repeated.

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
1. **Action**: Extract the integer part from \( \alpha \).
2. **Reasoning**: Consider what to do with the fractional part.
3. **Action**: Rewrite \( \alpha \).
4. **Reasoning**: Verify whether the new value is ready for another extraction or if you should stop.

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
1. **Initialization**: Begin with your real number \( \alpha \).
2. **Separation**: Divide \( \alpha \) into its integer and fractional components.
3. **Iteration**: Repeat the process with the updated value by rewriting \( \alpha \) in terms of fractios.
4. **Termination**: Stop when the process can not be repeated or if max number of iterations is reached.
6. **Result**: Collect the numbers forming the expansion.
