\section{Computing the Discrete Logarithm Modulo a Prime}
\subsection*{Question}
Find the smallest nonnegative integer \( x \) such that:
\[
2^x \equiv 11 \pmod{29}
\]
where 29 is a prime and 2 is a primitive root modulo 29.

In this problem, \( x \) is known as the \emph{discrete logarithm} of \( 11 \) to the base \( 2 \) modulo \( 29 \).

\vspace{1em}
\textbf{Technical Definitions:}
- **Primitive Root \(g\) Modulo \(p\):** An element \( g \) is a primitive root modulo \( p \) if the set \( \{g^0, g^1, \dots, g^{p-2}\} \) modulo \( p \) equals the set of all nonzero residues \(\{1, 2, \dots, p-1\}\).
- **Discrete Logarithm:** For given \( g \) and \( h \) modulo \( p \), it is the exponent \( x \) such that \( g^x \equiv h \pmod{p} \).

\subsection*{Hints}

\subsection*{Few-Shot Hinting}
Consider these scenarios:
- **Example 1:** With \( p = 23 \), \( g = 5 \), and \( h = 8 \), by examining successive powers, one finds an exponent \( x \) satisfying the congruence.
- **Example 2:** For a different small prime, observe how expressing the unknown exponent in two parts (a “large jump” part and a “small offset” part) can simplify the search by balancing precomputation with iteration.

\subsection*{Chain-of-Thought (CoT) Prompting}
\emph{"Notice that a direct brute-force search for \( x \) is computationally expensive. Think about expressing \( x \) as a sum of two numbers, \( x = i \cdot m + j \), where \( m \) is chosen to be roughly the square root of \( p-1 \). This insight allows you to precompute values for small exponents and then use a stepping procedure to cover larger exponents efficiently."}

\subsection*{Automatic Chain-of-Thought (Auto-CoT) Prompting}
\emph{"Step by step:
1. Identify a parameter \( m \) that is approximately \(\lceil \sqrt{p-1} \rceil\).
2. Precompute a collection of values corresponding to \( g^j \) for a limited range of small exponents \( j \).
3. Use a clever modular arithmetic trick to jump in larger increments (think of these as “giant steps”) by manipulating \( h \) appropriately.
4. Search for an overlap between the precomputed values and the iterated values from the large steps.
5. Combine the indices of the match to recover \( x \)."}

\subsection*{Self-Consistency}
\emph{"Before finalizing your answer:
- Confirm that \( p \) is prime and \( g \) is indeed a primitive root modulo \( p \).
- Verify that your choice of \( m \) effectively splits the problem into manageable parts.
- Always check your candidate \( x \) to ensure \( g^x \equiv h \pmod{p} \).
- Use small examples to validate your reasoning."}

\subsection*{Logical Chain-of-Thought (LogiCoT) Prompting}
\emph{"Reflect on the problem structure:
- Breaking \( x \) into two components \( i \) and \( j \) reduces the search space.
- Precomputation of a small set of values allows you to leverage modular arithmetic properties.
- The method relies on finding a match between two independently computed sets of values, guiding you to the correct exponent without exhaustive search."}

\subsection*{Chain-of-Symbol (CoS) Prompting}
\emph{"Represent the strategy symbolically:
- Define \( m = \lceil \sqrt{p-1} \rceil \) and express \( x \) as \( x = i \cdot m + j \).
- Precompute \( B[j] \equiv g^j \pmod{p} \) for \( 0 \le j < m \).
- Define a transformation using the modular inverse of \( g^m \) to compute values \( G[i] \) for \( i \ge 0 \).
- Identify indices \( i \) and \( j \) for which \( G[i] \equiv B[j] \); then \( x = i \cdot m + j \)."}

\subsection*{Structured Chain-of-Thought (SCoT) Prompting}
\emph{"Your outline should include:
1. **Initialization:** Choose \( m \approx \lceil \sqrt{p-1} \rceil \).
2. **Precomputation:** Create a lookup table for small exponent values \( g^j \pmod{p} \).
3. **Iterative Steps:** Use modular arithmetic to progress in large steps by modifying \( h \) appropriately.
4. **Matching Process:** Determine where the iterated value matches one from the lookup table.
5. **Result Synthesis:** Combine the corresponding indices to form the final exponent \( x \).
6. **Verification:** Ensure that the computed \( x \) satisfies the original congruence."}

\subsection*{ReAct Prompting}
\emph{"Proceed with the following actions:
- **Action:** Determine a suitable parameter \( m \) based on \( p \).
- **Reasoning:** Recognize that writing \( x \) as \( i \cdot m + j \) allows for a divide-and-conquer approach.
- **Action:** Precompute values for small exponents and store them.
- **Action:** Utilize a systematic method to advance in larger steps (using modular inverses or equivalent techniques).
- **Reasoning:** A match between the precomputed set and the iterated values reveals the necessary indices to reconstruct \( x \).
- **Action:** Verify the candidate solution by substitution."}

\subsection*{Clear and Specific Instructions}
\emph{"For the prime \( p \), primitive root \( g \), and integer \( h \):
1. Choose \( m \approx \lceil \sqrt{p-1} \rceil \).
2. Precompute the values \( g^j \mod p \) for \( j = 0, 1, \dots, m-1 \).
3. Compute a stepping factor related to \( g^m \) using modular arithmetic properties.
4. Iterate through a sequence of modified values of \( h \) using the stepping factor.
5. When a precomputed value is encountered, express \( x \) as a combination of the two indices.
6. Finally, confirm that your \( x \) satisfies \( g^x \equiv h \pmod{p} \)."}

\subsection*{Answer/Algorithm}
Step 1: Compute \( m = \lceil \sqrt{p - 1} \rceil = \lceil \sqrt{28} \rceil = 6 \)

Step 2: Precompute the "baby steps":
\[
\begin{align*}
2^0 &\equiv 1 \mod 29 \\
2^1 &\equiv 2 \mod 29 \\
2^2 &\equiv 4 \mod 29 \\
2^3 &\equiv 8 \mod 29 \\
2^4 &\equiv 16 \mod 29 \\
2^5 &\equiv 3 \mod 29 \\
\end{align*}
\]
Store these as: {1: 0, 2: 1, 4: 2, 8: 3, 16: 4, 3: 5}

Step 3: Compute the stepping factor:
\[
\text{Let } g^{-m} = 2^{-6} \equiv (2^{28 - 6}) = 2^{22} \mod 29
\]
\[
2^{22} \equiv 18 \mod 29
\]

Step 4: Perform "giant steps":
\[
\begin{align*}
i = 0: &\quad 11 \cdot 18^0 = 11 \mod 29 \\
i = 1: &\quad 11 \cdot 18^1 = 24 \mod 29 \\
i = 2: &\quad 11 \cdot 18^2 = 26 \mod 29 \\
i = 3: &\quad 11 \cdot 18^3 = 3 \mod 29
\end{align*}
\]

Match found: 3 is in the baby steps table with exponent 5. So:
\[
x = 3 \cdot 6 + 5 = 18 + 5 = 23
\]

Verification:
\[
2^{23} \equiv 11 \mod 29 \quad \text{✓}
\]

Final Answer:
\[
x = 23
\]
