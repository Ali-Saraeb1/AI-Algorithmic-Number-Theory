So, \\( a = 2 \\times 2 = 4 \\). We move to the next bit (which is the end of the binary representation).\n\nAfter iterating through all the bits, the value of the accumulator \\( a \\) is \\( 4 \\times 2 = 8 \\times 2 = 16 \\times 2 = 32 \\times 2 = 64 \\times 2 = 128 \\times 2 = 256 \\times 2 = 512 \\times 2 = 1024 \\).\n\nTherefore, the value of \\( 2^{10} \\) is \\(\\boxed{1024}\\)."
