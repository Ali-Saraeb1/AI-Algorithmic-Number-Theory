    "answer": "\\(\\lambda(60) = 4\\)\n\nTo compute the Carmichael function \\(\\lambda(60)\\), we start by factorizing 60 into its prime power factors:\n\\[ 60 = 2^2 \\times 3^1 \\times 5^1. \\]\n\nNext, we need to find the Carmichael function for each prime power factor. The Carmichael function \\(\\lambda(p^k)\\) for a prime power \\(p^k\\) is given by:\n\\[ \\lambda(p^k) = \\begin{cases} \n\\phi(p^k) & \\text{if } p = 2 \\text{ and } k \\leq 2, \\\\\n\\frac{\\phi(p^k)}{2} & \\text{if } p = 2 \\text{ and } k > 2, \\\\\n\\phi(p^k) & \\text{if } p > 2,\n\\end{cases} \\]\nwhere \\(\\phi\\) is the Euler's totient function.\n\nFirst, we compute \\(\\lambda(2^2)\\):\n\\[ \\phi(2^2) = 2^2 - 2^1 = 4 - 2 = 2, \\]\nso \\(\\lambda(2^2) = 2\\).\n\nNext, we compute \\(\\lambda(3^1)\\):\n\\[ \\phi(3^1) = 3^1 - 3^0 = 3 - 1 = 2, \\]\nso \\(\\lambda(3^1) = 2\\).\n\nFinally, we compute \\(\\lambda(5^1)\\):\n\\[ \\phi(5^1) = 5^1 - 5^0 = 5 - 1 = 4, \\]\nso \\(\\lambda(5^1) = 4\\).\n\nThe Carmichael function \\(\\lambda(60)\\) is the least common multiple (LCM) of \\(\\lambda(2^2)\\), \\(\\lambda(3^1)\\), and \\(\\lambda(5^1)\\):\n\\[ \\lambda(60) = \\text{lcm}(2, 2, 4) = 4. \\]\n\nTherefore, the Carmichael function \\(\\lambda(60)\\) is \\(\\boxed{4}\\)."
