Divide \\( 3 \\) by \\( 2 \\):\n   \\[ 3 = 2 \\cdot 1 + 1 \\]\n   So, \\( 3 - 2 \\cdot 1 = 1 \\).\n\n3. Divide \\( 2 \\) by \\( 1 \\):\n   \\[ 2 = 1 \\cdot 2 + 0 \\]\n   So, \\( 2 - 1 \\cdot 2 = 0 \\).\n\nThe gcd is the last non-zero remainder, which is \\( 1 \\). Since the gcd is \\( 1 \\), \\( 3 \\) and \\( 11 \\) are coprime, and an inverse exists.\n\n**Step 2: Apply the Extended Euclidean Algorithm**\n\nWe work backwards from the Euclidean Algorithm to express \\( 1 \\) as a combination of \\( 11 \\) and \\( 3 \\).\n\nFrom the second division:\n\\[ 1 = 3 - 2 \\cdot 1 \\]\n\nFrom the first division:\n\\[ 2 = 11 - 3 \\cdot 3 \\]\nSubstitute \\( 2 \\) in the previous equation:\n\\[ 1 = 3 - (11 - 3 \\cdot 3) \\cdot 1 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 3 - 11 + 3 \\cdot 3 \\]\n\\[ 1 = 3 \\cdot 4 - 11 \\]\n\nThis equation tells us that:\n\\[ 3 \\cdot 4 \\equiv 1 \\pmod{11} \\]\n\nTherefore, the multiplicative inverse of \\( 3 \\) in \\( \\mathbb{Z}/11\\mathbb{Z} \\) is \\( 4 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{4}\n\\]"
