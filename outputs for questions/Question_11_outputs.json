    "answer": "To list all prime numbers up to \\( N = 30 \\) using the Sieve of Eratosthenes, we follow these steps:\n\n1. **Conceptually prepare your candidate list:**\n   Start with a list of all integers from 2 to 30.\n   \\[\n   2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18, 19, 20, 21, 22, 23, 24, 25, 26, 27, 28, 29, 30\n   \\]\n\n2. **Understand that the smallest candidate in the list is key to eliminating composites:**\n   The smallest number in the list is 2, which is a prime number. We will use 2 to eliminate all its multiples.\n\n3. **Imagine marking off numbers that are clear multiples:**\n   Mark off all multiples of 2 starting from \\( 2^2 = 4 \\):\n   \\[\n   4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 30\n   \\]\n   The remaining numbers are:\n   \\[\n   2, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, 13, 15, 17, 19, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29\n   \\]\n\n4. **Reflect on how the process naturally avoids re-checking numbers:**\n   The next smallest number in the list is 3, which is also a prime number. We will use 3 to eliminate all its multiples. However, we only need to check multiples of 3 that are greater than or equal to \\( 3^2 = 9 \\) and are still in the list:\n   \\[\n   9, 15, 21, 27\n   \\]\n   Mark off these multiples:\n   \\[\n   9, 15, 21, 27\n   \\]\n   The remaining numbers are:\n   \\[\n   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 25, 29\n   \\]\n\n   The next smallest number in the list is 5, which is also a prime number. We will use 5 to eliminate all its multiples. However, we only need to check multiples of 5 that are greater than or equal to \\( 5^2 = 25 \\) and are still in the list:\n   \\[\n   25\n   \\]\n   Mark off this multiple:\n   \\[\n   25\n   \\]\n   The remaining numbers are:\n   \\[\n   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n   \\]\n\n   The next smallest number in the list is 7, which is also a prime number. We will use 7 to eliminate all its multiples. However, we only need to check multiples of 7 that are greater than or equal to \\( 7^2 = 49 \\) and are still in the list. Since 49 is greater than 30, we do not need to mark off any more multiples.\n\n5. **Final list of prime numbers:**\n   The remaining numbers in the list are all prime numbers:\n   \\[\n   2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29\n   \\]\n\nThus, the prime numbers up to \\( N = 30 \\) are:\n\\[\n\\boxed{2, 3, 5, 7, 11, 13, 17, 19, 23, 29}\n\\]"
