The prime factorization of \\( 65 \\) is:\n\\[ 65 = 5 \\times 13 \\]\n\nBoth \\( 5 \\) and \\( 13 \\) are congruent to \\( 1 \\pmod{4} \\), and their exponents are both 1, which are odd. However, since \\( 65 \\) is a product of two primes congruent to \\( 1 \\pmod{4} \\), it can be expressed as a sum of two squares. We can use the identity for the product of two sums of two squares:\n\\[ (a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ac + bd)^2 + (ad - bc)^2 \\]\n\nFor \\( 5 \\) and \\( 13 \\), we have:\n\\[ 5 = 1^2 + 2^2 \\]\n\\[ 13 = 2^2 + 3^2 \\]\n\nUsing the identity:\n\\[ 65 = (1 \\cdot 2 + 2 \\cdot 3)^2 + (1 \\cdot 3 - 2 \\cdot 2)^2 = (2 + 6)^2 + (3 - 4)^2 = 8^2 + (-1)^2 = 64 + 1 = 65 \\]\n\nThus, \\( 65 = 8^2 + 1^2 \\). Therefore, \\( N = 2 \\times 65 = 2 \\times (8^2 + 1^2) \\). We can use the identity for the product of a sum of two squares and a power of 2:\n\\[ 2(a^2 + b^2) = (a + b)^2 + (a - b)^2 \\]\n\nFor \\( a = 8 \\) and \\( b = 1 \\):\n\\[ 2(8^2 + 1^2) = (8 + 1)^2 + (8 - 1)^2 = 9^2 + 7^2 = 81 + 49 = 130 \\]\n\nTherefore, \\( N = 130 \\) can be expressed as \\( x^2 + y^2 \\) with \\( x = 9 \\) and \\( y = 7 \\).\n\nThe final answer is:\n\\[\n\\boxed{130 = 9^2 + 7^2}\n\\]"
